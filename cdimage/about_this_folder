ABOUT THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER

This folder contains files that are used for creating an OCAAS distribution CD.
It also contains some files that may be used for data archival.

In general, it has been a "miscellaneous" category source... it isn't a main
part of the OCAAS system.

The original CD Install creation scripts were pretty much specific to Elwood's 
installation.  These have been replaced with a different methodology.  As such
the original files have been removed. 

The new methodology calls for copying the cdbuilder directory to /home/cdbuilder
This could reflect an actual user, but it doesn't really need to.  You must
run the scripts there as root anyway.

Run the script 'makecd' to build a new distribution from scratch.

Run 'burncd' to create a new CD from an existing image.

The cd archival scripts remain unmodified as of the writing of this note.


Note that the environment variable CVSROOT must be properly set before running makecd

==========================================================

How to make a CD:

Create a directory named /home/cdbuilder.  This does not have to be associated with a user.
Create a place for the images to go (for example /cdimages)
Have an older version of OCAAS (Talon) handy in order to copy catalog files

You will need to have a valid CVSROOT environment variable and CVS access set up correctly

You should also document any changes in README-UPGRADE (telescope/cdimage/cdbuilder) if
you are making a new version.

You must also tag (cvs tag -c Version-2_X_XX) the cvs version before doing a makecd if
you are making a new version.

As root, from the telescope/cdimage director, run ./update_cdbuilder to put latest changes
into the /home/cdbuilder directory

As root, run ./makecd from the /home/cdbuilder folder
