This directory includes the FLI CCD device driver module for Linux, fli.o.
It should be compatible with any 2.2.x kernel.  Use the insmod(1) or
modprobe(1) command to install the module.  The only mandatory module
parameter is I/O base address of the parallel port through which FLI
devices are attached.  Use the modinfo(1) command to list other parameters
this module supports.

Examples of installing the module using insmod(1):

	insmod -f fli.o io=0x378

	insmod -f fli.o io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3

Once the module is installed, information describing the state of the
module can be found in /proc/fli/fli_info.  To use the module, a character
special file having the major listed in /proc/fli/fli_info and minor number
of 0 must exist.  Use the mknod(1) command to create such a file.

Example of creating the FLI CCD character special file /dev/ccd0:

	mknod -m 666 /dev/ccd0 c 254 0

This example assumes 254 is the major number listed in /proc/fli/fli_info.

The I/O control requst codes supported by this module are documented in
fli_ioctl.pdf or doc/index.html.
