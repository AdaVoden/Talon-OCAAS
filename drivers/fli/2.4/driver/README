This directory includes the FLI CCD device driver module for Linux, fli.o.
It should be compatible with any 2.2.x kernel.  Use the insmod(1) or
modprobe(1) command to install the module.  The only mandatory module
parameter is I/O base address of the parallel port through which FLI
devices are attached.  Use the modinfo(1) command to list other parameters
this module supports.

  Examples of installing the module using insmod(1):

        insmod ./fli.o io=0x378

        insmod ./fli.o io=0x378 irq=7 dma=3

This module supports multiple parallel ports (up to 8) by specifying
multiple I/O base addresses when loading the module, for example:

        insmod ./fli.o io=0x378,0x278 irq=7,9 dma=3,2

In this example the first port's settings are I/O 0x378, IRQ 7, DMA 3.  The
settings of the second port are I/O 0x278, IRQ 9, DMA 2.

Once the module is installed, information describing the state of the
parallel port(s) being used can be found in
/proc/fli/fliport_<port #>/fli_info.  To use the module, a character
special file having the major listed in /proc/fli/fliport_<port #>/fli_info
and minor number corresponding to the parallel port number must exist.  Use
the mknod(1) command to create such a file.

Examples of creating the FLI CCD character special files /dev/ccd0 and
/dev/ccd1:

        mknod -m 666 /dev/ccd0 c 254 0
        mknod -m 666 /dev/ccd1 c 254 1

This example assumes 254 is the major number listed in
/proc/fli/fliport_<port #>/fli_info, and creates two character special
files, both having major number 254.  In this example /dev/ccd0 corresponds
to the first port (minor number 0) and /dev/ccd1 corresponds to the second
port (minor number 1).

The I/O control request codes supported by this module are documented in
fli_ioctl.pdf and doc/index.html.
