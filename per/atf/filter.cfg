! ATF Details about the filter wheel motor
IAXIS		t		! pc39 motor axis

! If using the Torus filter, set following to 1 and ignore the remaining setup
IHAVETORUS	0		! 

IHAVE 		1		! 1 for filter wheel control, 0 to disable.
IHASLIM		0		! 1 if this axis uses limit switches, else 0.
IPOSSIDE	1		! 1 to use the cw side of home sw, else 0
IHOMELOW	1		! 1 if home switch is active low, else 0
ISTEP		400		! usteps per full revolution (or tray travel)
ISIGN		1		! 1 if raw pos moves cw, -1 if ccw
I1STEP		40		! usteps between each filter position
IOFFSET		-1		! usteps from home to first filter center
ILIMMARG 	0		! limit backoff safety margin (if limits), rads
IMAXVEL 	1.5915		! max focus motor velocity, rads/sec
IMAXACC 	3.1831		! max focus motor acceleration, rads/sec/sec
ISLIMACC 	100		! soft limit and urgent acc, rads/sec/sec

! Details about each filter. Each entry consists of up to 5 fields, separated
! by commas (,) as follows, (each also lists a default if missing):
!
!   Name, must begin with a unique letter, case is ignored (required)
!   flat calibration time, seconds (FLATDURDEF)
!   flat light source intensity, 1..3	(FLATLTEDEF)
!   focus setting 1 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (NOMPOSDEF/FILTTDEF)
!   focus setting 2 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (setting 1)
!

FLATDURDEF	5		! default flat duration, secs
FLATLTEDEF      1		! default flat illumination level, 1..3
NOMPOSDEF	0		! default focus position, microns from home
FILTTDEF	10		! default temperature, C

FILT0		'Clear'
FILT1		'Blue'
FILT2		'Visual'
FILT3		'Red'
FILT4		'Infrared'
FILT5		'W H Alpha'
FILT6		'X H Off'
FILT7		'Y H Beta'
FILT8		'Z O III'
FILT9		'None'

NFILT		10		! total number of filter positions

FDEFLT		'Clear'		! default filter after homing

! N.B. Even if IHAVE is set to 0, FDEFLT must still be defined and will be
! used to store flat and focus info. FILT* and NFILT must also be sensible.
