! ATF platform

! Main axes calibration constants which are just filled in once forever.
! N.B. home.cfg has more which must be set once but are updated dynamically.
! N.B. use `dynamics' tool to find best settings of MAXVEL/MAXACC/POLL_PERIOD.
! N.B. all measures and directions are canonical unless stated as raw.

! "H" refers to the longitudinal axis, ie, ha or az.
! "D" refers to the latitudinal axis, ie, dec or alt.
! "R" refers to the field rotator -- must be present but ignored if don't have.
