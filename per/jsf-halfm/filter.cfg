! Details about the filter wheel motor
IAXIS		t		! pc39 motor axis

! If using the Torus filter, set following to 1 and ignore the remaining setup
IHAVETORUS	0		! 

IHAVE 		1		! 1 for filter wheel control, 0 to disable.
IHASLIM		0		! 1 if this axis uses limit switches, else 0.
IPOSSIDE	1		! 1 to use the cw side of home sw, else 0
IHOMELOW	1		! 1 if home switch is active low, else 0
ISTEP		7300		! usteps per full revolution (or tray travel)
ISIGN		-1		! 1 if raw pos moves cw, -1 if ccw
I1STEP		730		! usteps between each filter position
IOFFSET		0		! usteps from home to first filter center
ILIMMARG 	.1		! limit backoff safety margin (if limits), rads
IMAXVEL 	.6		! max focus motor velocity, rads/sec
IMAXACC 	.8		! max focus motor acceleration, rads/sec/sec
ISLIMACC 	10		! soft limit and urgent acc, rads/sec/sec

! Details about each filter. Each entry consists of up to 5 fields, separated
! by commas (,) as follows, (each also lists a default if missing):
!
!   Name, must begin with a unique letter, case is ignored (required)
!   flat calibration time, seconds (FLATDURDEF)
!   flat light source intensity, 1..3	(FLATLTEDEF)
!   focus setting 1 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (NOMPOSDEF/FILTTDEF)
!   focus setting 2 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (setting 1)
!

FLATDURDEF	5		! default flat duration, secs
FLATLTEDEF      1		! default flat illumination level, 1..3
NOMPOSDEF	65		! default focus position, microns from home
FILTTDEF	0		! default temperature, C

NFILT		10		! total number of filter positions

FDEFLT		'0NoFilter'	! default filter after homing

! N.B. Even if IHAVE is set to 0, FDEFLT must still be defined and will be
! used to store flat and focus info. FILT* and NFILT must also be sensible.
