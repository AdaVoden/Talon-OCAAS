! Details about each filter. Each entry consists of up to 5 fields, separated
! by commas (,) as follows, (each also lists a default if missing):
!
!   Name, must begin with a unique letter, case is ignored (required)
!   flat calibration time, seconds (FLATDURDEF)
!   flat light source intensity, 1..3	(FLATLTEDEF)
!   focus setting 1 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (NOMPOSDEF/FILTTDEF)
!   focus setting 2 as "microns_from_home/temperature_C" (setting 1)
!

FLATDURDEF      2               ! default flat duration, secs
FLATLTEDEF      1               ! default flat illumination level, 1..3
NOMPOSDEF	-11299.8	! default focus position, microns from home
FILTTDEF	0		! default temperature, C

FILT0		'Wavecut'
FILT1		'Infrared'
FILT2		'Red'
FILT3		'Visual'

NFILT		4			! total number of filter positions

FDEFLT		'Wavecut'

! N.B. Even if IHAVE is set to 0, FDEFLT must still be defined and will be
! used to store flat and focus info. FILT* and NFILT must also be sensible.
