! Fill in the rough initial values for the telescope orientation, limit
! switch positions and directions, and motor steps per rev once. They are
! updated as we learn better values.

! "H" refers to the longitudinal axis, ie, ha or az.
! "D" refers to the latitudinal axis, ie, dec or alt.
! "R" refers to the field rotator -- must be present but ignored if don't have.
! "O" refers to focus motor -- must be present but ignored if don't have.
! "I" refers to filter wheel -- must be present but ignored if don't have.

! initial guesses -- fill these in once by hand for a new installation
