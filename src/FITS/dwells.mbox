Good! This subject is known in the FITS community as the "WCS" [World
Coordinate Systems] conventions.

Good idea. You are not restricted to use of GSC --- there are
competitor sources, and they don't have to be on CD-ROM, they are
available via Internet. The latter case falls under the heading of
"Postage-Stamp" services. After the ADASS meeting in Baltimore, we
established an Email exploder for providers and customers of these
services to coordinate protocols. As a part of that effort, the latest
revs of SAOimage support WCS. The GSFC postage stamp server supplies
little GSC images of designated places with FITS WCS headers...

These were originally devised by Eric Greisen circa 1982-3 for the
AIPS project, and have subsequently been widely adopted by the radio,
infrared and high-energy communities. There are no competing
conventions.

The "RA--" and "DEC-" parts have the obvious meaning.  The "-SIN"
means that the image has sine projection geometry, also known as
orthographic. Radio synthesis imaging systems produce this geometry.
Most optical imaging systems produce the "-TAN", or gnomonic, geometry
(this is probably what you want to use for your telescope). Schmidt
cameras produce "-ARC", also known as azimuthal equidistant. There are
an infinity of other projections which are used for a wide variety of
purposes, such as the Mercator ("-MER") and Aitoff-Hammer Equal Area
("-AIT") projections. The proposed standard for all of this is

aerobic workout --- send this one to your fastest, smartest printer!)

You should also read chapter 4 (World Coordinate Systems) of the NOST
FITS User's Guide, which is

 > .. CROTA1,2. .. need.. rotation about.. > optical axis..

Use the 1983 AIPS convention for simple rotations: set the rotation
for the RA-like axis to zero and put your position angle into the
rotation for the Dec-like axis. In most cases, this means
    CROTA1  =       0.0 /
    CROTA2  =   <angle> / in degrees
You _may_ be able to deduce the sign convention for CROTA2 from first
principles after reading the two documents whose URLs are given above,
but I wouldn't bet on it. In practice, you can simply pop up your test
image on AIPS or SAOimage or IRAF, and point at some catalog stars to
compare their indicated coordinates with book values. Flip sign as
needed.

Oooooops... that paragraph is unresponsive to your question. Sigh... I
was telling you about one of my pet ideas. The GSC is just a list of
star coordinates.  The postage_stamp servers supply _images_ with
attached WCS info. I responded as I did because when you said "GSC", I
thought of the CD-ROMs of compressed survey imagery (the GSFC server
will supply images computed from those files).  One huge advantage of
the postage_stamp approach is that it can work with reference stars
100x fainter, and over fields of view less than an arc-minute if
necessary. So technology based on image matching could be used to
attach WCS info to CCD images from big telescopes (like the Mayall
4m).
