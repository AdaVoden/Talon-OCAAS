WCSLIB consists of independent C and FORTRAN implementations of the spherical
projection equations defined in the World Coordinate System proposal for FITS
(Flexible Image Transport System).

The separate C and FORTRAN implementations are provided for programming
convenience, usually only one or the other need be compiled.  Which to use
depends on what language is used for the applications which use WCSLIB.

Further detailed information is provided with the C and FORTRAN sources.
