This directory contains some tools used to build and maintain OCAAS. These
make your life more organized and pleasant - use them! Never underestimate
the advantage of careful source code control. The goal is always to be able
to recreate the world from the source tree by using "Make.all -reset <system>".


=== STO 4/19/2001 ===
updated to CVS.. some of the rcs utilities here will not work.
Did update Make. scripts though.
Note that you should have source in a directory named torus/talon
and a symbolic link named telescope that points to this.
This insures old scripts work with new directory structure format...

=============

Ins.mklogin
    make the ocaas login and add OCAAS booting to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

Ins.mktelhome
    build a fresh directory stucture off $TELHOME

Make.all
    rebuild the world. use -reset to rebuild $TELHOME too. argument is
    one of the systems in the pre/ directory. Also contains a description
    of each build pass.

Make.pass
    Make.all does the building in several passes. This script does one pass.

Make.tools
    This runs only those passes to make programs useful on systems without 
    direct connection to a telescope.

Makefile
    just runs Ins.mklogin for pass8a

findrefs
    use this to find all .c and .h files which refer to a given identifier.
    can list just the file names or the lines themselves.

loc
    produce a report of total lines of code

rcsnew
    use this to add proper RCS control lines to a new file.

rcspurge
    use this to remove old versions of code that will never be used again.

rcssincetag
    use this print the control comments from all files changed since a
    given tag was issued.

rcstree
    run any rcs command on a tree of files. useful for lots of things, such
    as a checking out all files with a certain version tag, or assigning
    a version tag to all files when making a new release.

sourceme
    handy macros and aliases. source this in your ~/.cshrc

telbu
    make a full backup of everything.
