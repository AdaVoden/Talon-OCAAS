Welcome to The Automated Telescope Remote Observers Page.  The Table of 
Contents is designed to assist you in completing you observing request.
<p>
Before you can observe, it is necessary to have a <a href="code_request.shtml" target="mainframe">remote observer's code.</a>  This is a three letter code 
which allows us to tag your images for retrieval.  It also gives us a nice idea
of where everyone is from.
<p>
Once you have an observers code, you can go straight to the <a href="obs_submission.shtml" target="mainframe">Observation Submission Form.</a>  The <a href="guide.shtml" target="mainframe">observer's guide</a> will assist you in preparing your 
observing proposal.<p>
You will also find links to current weather conditions and status of the telescope.  It is also possible to see the most recently acquired image from the
ATF.<p>

Thanks again fro using the ATF.  If you have any comments, please send them
to <a href="mailto:atfproj@astro.physics.uiowa.edu">atfproj@astro.physics.uiowa.edu.</a>
