Crop is a program which crops a set of FITS images to the largest common AOI.
Or, crop can be given a file which lists OBJECT names and AOIs and it will crop
each image to that AOI. Or, crop can be given an AOI on its command line and it
will crop all images to that.

N.B. It creates the new cropped images IN PLACE. Copy the images first if
you want them preserved.

Usage:

crop [options] [*.fts]
    -a AOI	crops all images to the given AOI. The AOI is in the form:
		"East_RA North_Dec West_RA South_Dec", RA as H:M:S, Dec as D:M:S
    -c		crops all images to their maximum common AOI.
    -l file	crops to AOI for matching OBJECTs listed in given file.
		file format is: OBJECT East_RA North_Dec West_RA South_Dec.
    -f file	list of files to crop.
    -v		verbose
