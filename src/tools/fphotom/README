Fphotom is a program for producing true photometric magnitudes for all stars in
a color field, that is, all stars that are found in common among a set of four
images taken through B, V, R and I filters. Photometric calibration constants
for the night of the image set are read from the file photcal.out, or from a
set of standard defaults in photcal.def if no date matches. The output is a
table of star positions and their B, V, R and I values, with error estimates,
and the geometric mean and ratio (Y to X) of their full-width-half-max values,
one star per line.

Usage:

fphotom: [options] config_file
Options:
  -c file: photmetric constants file.
           default is photcal.out
  -d file: default file to use when date not found.
           default is photcal.def.
  -p file: directory of out/def files;
           default is /home1/ccdoper/archive/photcal
  -v:      verbose.
Required:
  config_file


The config_file is required and must consist of exactly either 2 or 5 lines.

In either case, the first line contains two fields, separated by whitespace,
to define the photometry parameters:

    rsrch:   max radius to search for brightest pixel
    rap:     aperture radius, pixels.

The file may then have four additional lines which are the names of images
of the same field through B, V, R, and I filters. The filenames may be given in
any order.

Or, the file may have one additional line which begins with a * and is the name
of a file which contains the names of the four BVRI filter images, exactly as
though they appeared directly in the config file as above.
