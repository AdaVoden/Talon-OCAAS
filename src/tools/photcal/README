Photcal scans a directory of images of photometric standard fields and,
along with standard field name information in photcal.ref and default k''
values from photcal.def, determines a set of 8 photometric parameters: V0 and
k' for each of 4 colors, BVRI, which best-fits the image data. These values
are written in a form suitable for use with fphotom and so, by default, photcal
appends the new set of values with a date header to the file photcal.cal. The
values of k'' are held constant and may be read from photcal.def or changed on
the command line. Run the program with no arguments to display the built-in
defaults.

The photometric model is from Simon et al 1994 and can be summarized as follows:

	V = Vobs + V0 + k'Z + k''(B-V)

where:

    Symbol	Meaning				Role/Source

    V  		true apparent magnitude		per star, from photcal.ref
    Vobs	observed magnitude 		per star, from pixels
    V0		instrumental correction		to be solved
    Z 		air mass			per field, from header
    B-V		color index			per star, drivd from photcal.ref
    k' 		airmass dependency		to be solved
    k''		color index dependency		to be solved

This equation is repeated for each color B, V, R and I. Thus, the total
solution consists of 8 numbers: V0 and k' for each color. (Be careful not to
confuse the color V with the V in the equation).

Stars with SNR < 4.0 are rejected.

Usage summary;
./photcal: [options] mm/dd/yyyy
Options:
  -i dir:  directory of images; default is archive/photcal
  -p file: directory for def/ref/out files; default is archive/photcal
  -d file: default k'' values filename; default is photcal.def
  -r file: field ids filename; default is photcal.ref
  -c file: calibration filename to append to (- means stdout);
           default is photcal.out
  -k B V R I: values of k'' for each color;
           may be set from file using -d or built-in
           defaults are: -0.46 -0.15 -0.02 -0.06
  -t days: +/- days image's JD may vary from given date; default is 0.5
  -v:      verbose: generates additional output
  -m:      print name, Z, filter, observed mag and err for each star.

Required:
  mm/dd/yyyy: date for which constants are to be determined
           d may be a real number; y is full year, eg, 1995

The program prints error messages to stderr but usually tries to keep going.

The resulting values are appended to the output file in the following format.
No output is generated if there are not sufficient data to solve for all four
sets of values.

JD (M/D/Y)

B: V0 k' k''
V: V0 k' k''
R: V0 k' k''
I: V0 k' k''
