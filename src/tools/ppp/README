An example of a remote site checking in via an ISP on a regular basis to
upload new images and weather data and download a new .sls file.

dxpc is unrelated.. but is a nifty tool which gives 4-5x improvement
running X over a phone line. It is needed on both ends. Here is an
excerpt from the man page (-f means fork and run as a daemon):

       Assume that you're running a real X server on the  console
       of a local workstation called homepc, and that you want to
       run some X applications on a remote  system  called  work-
       server  and  have them display on the console of the local
       system.

       On workserver, run
           $ export DISPLAY=homepc:0
           $ dxpc -f
           $ export DISPLAY=unix:8

       On homepc, run
           $ export DISPLAY=unix:0
           $ dxpc -f workserver

       Now on workserver,
           $ xterm&
           $ xemacs&
           etc...
