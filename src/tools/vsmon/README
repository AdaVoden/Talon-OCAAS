Vsmon is a program for monitoring a set of variable stars over an extended
period. The list of stars to monitor is specified in a catalog file. The format
is detailed below. vsmon scans a given directory of fits images and checks each
image against the catalog to produce one line of output for each image whose
OBJECT field is found in the catalog. The format of the output is detailed
below.



Usage:
usage: ./vsmon [options]
  -b     : use bright-walk star search method. default is max-in-area.
  -c file: alternate catalog file.
           default is /home1/ccdoper/archive/photcal/vsmon.lst
  -i file: alternate image directory.
           default is /home1/ccdoper/user/images
  -o file: alternate output file; use - for stdout.
           default is /home1/ccdoper/archive/photcal/vsmon.out
  -r rmax: max radius to search for star, pixels. default is 12
  -v:      verbose


The catalog file format consists of three lines per target star, as follows.
There is one line for the target star, and one line each for the calibrator and
check stars. All fields are separated by blanks. Blank lines and lines which
begin with # are ignored.


C name RA Dec V B-V V-R V-I
K name RA Dec V B-V V-R V-I
T name RA Dec V B-V V-R V-I

where:
    C/K/T:	The first column is one of the characters C, K or T. These
		serve to mark each entry as the Calibrator, Check, or Target,
		respectvively. They must appear in the first column and always
		in the order C then K then T for each star group.
    name:	The second column is the name of the star. Only the name of
		the Target star is used by vsmon for anything. No spaces are
		allowed.
    RA:		The third column is the RA of the star. The format is H:M:S.
    Dec:	The fourth column is the Dec of the star. The format is D:M:S.

    V:		The last 4 columns are the magnitudes of the star in several
    B-V:	bands. Column five is the magnitude in the V band; column six
    V-R:	is the B-V magnitude; column seven is the V-R magnitude; and
    V-I		column eigth is the V-I magnitude.



The output file consists of one line per file as follows:

FName OName UD UT HJD Z F TMag TErr TTrig KDiff KErr

where:
    FName:	name of file
    OName:	name of object
    UD:		UT Date of observation, M/D/Y
    UT:		UT Time of observation, H:M:S
    HJD:	JD of observation, corrected to Heliocentric time
    Z:		airmass
    F:		filter code
    TMag:	computed true magnitude of target star
    TErr:	statistical error in TMag, in magnitudes
    TTrig:	Y if TMag is >= the trigger threshold, else N.
    KDiff:	measured - expected check star magnitude
    KErr:	statistical error in check star, in magnitudes
