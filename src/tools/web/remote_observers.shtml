Lynn is originally from Grinnell, Iowa. He became interested in 
astronomy by watching Star Wars and Star Trek.  Lynn has co-authored a paper 
on asteroid rotation periods with fellow observers Brita Nellermoe 
and John Armstrong.  In addition, he has published a paper with
Brita Nellermoe concerning their research on AB Andromeda.  Lynn is also the 
mentor for the undergraduate research group looking for new variable stars.  
When not studying astronomy or wrestling with the ATF's data storage 
problems, Lynn enjoys reading science fiction and fantasy books, and playing 
role playing games.<p>

John is a computer science major at the University of Iowa.  He
holds two fun and interesting jobs, one of which is working at the University 
of Iowa Theater Building constructing scenery, the other as an observer
for The University of Iowa Automated Telescope Facility.  John has recently 
begun a research project with David Lewis observing the comet Hale-Bopp.  
In the future he hopes to actively participate in the continuing expansion 
of the ATF and its ever increasing community of observers.<p>

A senior in physics and astronomy, John involves himself in a number of 
projects directly and indirectly associated with the ATF.  In addition to
being an active telescope operator and supervising a program to monitor  
cataclysmic variable stars, John is currently assisting with the development 
of a fiber fed spectrometer for the new Iowa Robotic Observatory.  John
enjoys outdoor activity of any nature.  Originally from Denver, Colorado, 
John spends a large portion of his free time adjusting to life in Iowa.<p>

Jenny is a junior majoring in Physics
and Astronomy.  She has been interested in science, and astronomy in
particular, for as long as she can remember.  The reason Jenny is still 
interested in these areas is because she can't imagine anything more 
incredible or worthwhile than trying to figure out how the universe works.  
As for her hobbies, Jenny likes to read (mainly sci-fi).  When she has time,
she enjoys playing old school video games, especially the Sega 8-bit system. 
Jenny is originally from Ames, Iowa and whenever she makes it home she 
loves spending lots of time with her dog, Pudgy.<p>

John is a junior physics and astronomy major at the University of Iowa
Aside from school, John enjoys hanging out with friends, sailing and all
types of sports.  When home in Sioux City, Iowa, he enjoys playing with his dog
and seeing his family.  To put it in John's own words: "Overall, I am just 
an average college student trying to squeeze in as much fun as possible in 
my four years here; therefore, any advice taken from me should be labeled, 
like an unguarded swimming pool, 'Use At Your Own Risk'".<p>

Dr. Mutel is a professor and research scientist for the University of Iowa 
Department of Physics and Astronomy.  In addition to his teaching and research
resposibilities, he is also the man behind the creation of the Automated 
Telescope Facility, and advisor to the undergraduate observers.<p>

Brita has left the University of Iowa to attend graduate school at the
University of North Dakota.  Formerly our PR person and remote observer
liason, we have no illusions as to the amount of extra work her absence has
placed upon us, as she has mighty big shoes to fill.  She will be missed.
