mntmodel will read a set of HA/Dec and X/Y encoder quads on stdin and find
and print a best mount model on stdout suitable for direction inclusion in
home.cfg. the intented usage recipe is something like:

	pterror -t *.fts | (mntmodel -r >> home.cfg ) |& sort +4 -rn x.resid

where the fts files given to pterror came from a pointing mesh and -r means
print each residual on stderr.

The stdin are lines of the form:

	HA Dec XEnc YEnc

    where HA and Dec are sky coordinates, rads
    XEnc and YEnc are the scope's long and lat axis angles from home, rads

Lines not containing four floats are ignored and may be used as comments.

To review the model,

    HT		HA of scope pole, rads
    DT		Dec of scope pole, rads
    XP		angle from home to beneath celestial pole,
		    rads ccw as seen from tel pole
    YC		angle from scope's equator to home, rads +N
    NP		nonperpendicularity of axes, rads

2 stars produce a closed-form solution with NP set to 0. 3 or more give
a least-square solution which minimizes the distances between the measured
encoder values and those predicted by the model.

usage:

mntmodel: [options]
Purpose: find best mount model from pointing data.
Synopsis: pterrors -t *.fts | mntmodel >> home.cfg
 -H HT: set initial guess at HT (use after -d to override)
 -D DT: set initial guess at DT (use after -d to override)
 -X XP: set initial guess at XP (use after -d to override)
 -Y YC: set initial guess at YC (use after -d to override)
 -t t : set desired model tolerance, rads (use after -d to override)
 -d   : get all defaults from telescoped.cfg and home.cfg
 -f   : turn on GERMEQ_FLIP
 -g   : turn on GERMEQ
 -i   : print model initial conditions on stderr
 -z   : turn on ZENFLIP
 -r   : print residuals on stderr
