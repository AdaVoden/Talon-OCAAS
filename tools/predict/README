Predict prints out a list of times when eclipsing binary stars will be at a
minima. Only minima which occur during local night with the star above the
horizon and within abs(HA) < 6 are shown, unless the -a switch is used.
The program requires two environment variables: LATITUDE, in rads +N, and
LONGITUDE, rads +W.

Usage: predict [options]
    -a:          show all minima, regardless of dusk/dawn/up/HA limits, etc.
    -d m/d/y:    starting date (y is full year, as in 1996); default is today.
    -f starfile: alternate star list;
		 default is /brutus/astrolabs/labimage/varstars/ecl-bin.txt.
    -n minima:   number of consecutive minima to report; default is 1.
    -s starname: name of star; default is all stars in star list file.

The program requires a file of known minima for the stars to be predicted. This
file consists of 10 columns, as follows:

    Name	the name of the star.
    RA-h,m,s	three columns for RA hour, minute and second (J2000)
    Dec-d,m,s	three columns for Dec degrees, minutes, seconds; the first
		of these may be immediately preceeded with + or -
    P		period, days.
    JD0		Julian date of a minima, referenced to heliocentric time.
    Mag		Magnitude range as Brightest-DimmestX, where X is a
		one-character band code such as B, V, R or I.

The output consists of the several columns for each star and minimum in range,
as follows.


    Name	the name of the star.
    Date	date of minimum, M/D/Y UT.
    JD		time of minimum, JD.
    Dusk	time of dusk the night of the minimum, UT.
    UT		time of minimum, UT.
    Dawn	time of dawn the night of the minimum, UT.
    LST		time of minimum, Local Sideral Time.
    HA		Hour angle of star at minimum, H:M:S.
    Elev	Elevation of star at minimum, Degrees.
