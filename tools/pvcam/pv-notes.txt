The files in the PVCAM folder are for two development paths.

Both are unique to the Pixel Vision camera implementation for JSF

The first is for the 1/2 meter camera.  This involves the files:

	pvcam.pl
	========
	This is the camera "driver" script used for the 1/2 Meter.
	It includes support for cutup and naming and calling the
	pipeline process.
	
	naming.pl
	=========
	This file is used by both the 1/2 meter and 1-meter. It defines
	the process by which the files are named according to coordinates
	and shutter codes.
	
	pvcam.cfg-halfm
	===============
	This is the configuration file as set for the half-m installation.
	This should be be reconciled with the version in
	telescope/per/jsf-halfm
	
	pvcam.virtual
	=============
	A version of the half-m implmentation for testing, using the
	stsci vcam method for simulating a camera
	
	pvcam.cfg-vir
	=============
	The config file for the virtual mode
	
also, perhaps perversely, the files calimagePV and pipeline,
created by daemons/telrun.jsf build, are also used.
	
The original, pre-pipeline, version of pvcam (from Elwood) exists as

	pvcam.original.

The files
	
	settings.exp
	settings.sav
	
are keepsakes leftover from Elwood's work.

---------------------------------------------------------	
	
The 1-Meter implementation uses these files

	pvc1m.cfg.pl
	============
	This is the common configuration file used by all of the
	following scripts.  It contains all the settings needed
	for a test environment.  The actual settings should be
	kept stored in telescope/per/jsf-onem

	naming.pl
	=========
	This file is used by both the 1/2 meter and 1-meter. It defines
	the process by which the files are named according to coordinates
	and shutter codes.
			
	pc1m-mstr.pl
	============
	This is the master script, and is what the camera.cfg file
	should point to; what Camera calls. It dispatches to each
	slave script on the four satellite machines.
	
	pc1m-slave.pl
	=============
	This script is executed on each of the satellite machines. It
	handles the actual download, storage, and pipeline initiation.
	It also handles the sky monitor feedback.
	
	pipeln1m.pl
	===========
	This is the pipeline script as implemented for the 1-meter
	
	pipeln1m.cfg.pl
	===============
	This is the separate configuration file for the 1-M pipeline
	script.
	
	pvcam.cfg.1M.pl
	===============
	This is an "adapter" script, which replaces pvcam.cfg on the
	1-M system because calimagePV expects to find pvcam.cfg.  This
	will convert the section names from the format used in the 1M
	to the format used in the 1/2 meter.
	
	offsetfits.pl
	=============
	This script is called by the postprocess function (telrun.jsf version) for
	the one-meter.  It offsets the RA/DEC coordinates of the image that was
	saved as the return image so that the pointing mesh operations can work
	properly.
	
	skycam
	======
	This is a simple utility script that runs camera with the
	new -listen option, setting it to SkyListen for purposes
	of the sky monitor feedback.
	
	testgo.pl
	=========
	This is used only in testing. It copies from a saved set of
	images to roughly simulate the action of the pv setup.
	
Remember that telrun.jsf must be built for the proper postprocess and calimagePV
ALSO - in GUI/pvoptions is the "pvoptions" program.  This is a GUI that will set
the common settings found in the config files and give easier control over
return section selection and enabling / disabling process options.	
	

The lpio program is the parallel port signal generator, and is used
by both the 1/2 meter and 1 meter implementations.  See the Makefile
for proper ownership settings of lpio.

The Makefile will build properly for the 'site' tags "jsf-halfm" and
"jsf-onem". There is are also build targets for the virtual and for
a 1-M test mode (see makefile).
