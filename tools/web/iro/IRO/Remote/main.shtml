Welcome to the Iowa Robotic Telescope Observer page.  The Table of 
Contents is designed to assist you in completing your observing request.

<p>Before you can observe, it is necessary to have a <a
href="code_request.shtml">remote observer's code</a>.  This is a three letter
code which allows us to tag your images for retrieval.  It also gives us a
nice idea of where everyone is from.

<p>Once you have an observers code, you can go straight to the <a
href="submit_formatq.shtml">Observation Submission Form</a>.  The <a
href="guide.shtml">observer's guide</a> will assist you in preparing your
observing proposal.

<p> You will also find links to current weather conditions and status of
the telescope.
<p>

Thanks again for using the IRO.  If you have any comments, please send them
to our <a href="mailto:liason@iro.physics.uiowa.edu">internet liason.</a>
