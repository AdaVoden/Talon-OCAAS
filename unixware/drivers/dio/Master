# This is new in SVR4.2; ergo, the first non-comment line must be `$version 1'.
# for a complete description, read the `master' man page.
# `idinstall -k -a dio' copies this to /etc/conf/mdevice.d/dio. (-k keeps)
# format: module-name prefix characteristics order bmaj cmaj
#   characteristics: all sorts of things; c means this is a char driver
#   order: order to call init and start; 0 means don't care.
#   bmaj: block device major number, if not using auto-assignment.
#   mmaj: char device major number, if not using auto-assignment.
