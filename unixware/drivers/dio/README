Put one line per (potential) board in System. We don't support interrupts.
Put one line per (potential) board in Node. The minor device number just ends
    up being the line number (0, 1, 2...) from System; think of it as a
    "board" number. If they are different, you might call them, say, /dev/dio96
    and /dev/dio24; if you have two dio96 you might call them, say,
    /dev/dio96_0 and /dev/dio96_1.
You can specify a larger board and plug in a smaller one and the driver will
    sense the missing 8255's and adjust; only downside is a little wasted
    I/O address space. No attempt is made to notice a larger board.
Space.c is only able to handle a max of 3 boards. No adjustment is needed to
    this unless you want 4 (?!) boards at once.
